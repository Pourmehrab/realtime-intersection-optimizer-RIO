============
.. note::
   The program is to simulate the performance of an isolated intersection under traffic of AV and conventional
   vehicles with variety of signal control methods.

.. warning::
   - The Python requirement is set to 3.5.2
   - Install packages using ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``
   - For simulation, the directory ``\data\`` shall includes ``<intersection name>.csv`` which has the scenarios
      to be tested. Note the filename should match the intersection name.
   - SI units(speed in m/s, length in :math:`m`, time in :math:`s`, acceleration in :math:`m/s^2`)
   - Run ``python main <intersection_name> <optimization_algo>``
       * intersection name could be ``13th16th`` or ``reserv``
       * optimization algorithm could be ``GA, pretimed`` or ``MCF``
   - Outputs are populated under ``\log``:
      * ``<intersection name>_vehicle_level`` includes input csv plus the ``departure time`` and
         ``elapsed time`` columns.
      * ``<intersection name>_trj_point_level.csv`` includes the trajectory points.
